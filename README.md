## 🏗️ Architecture

The project is structured using the **Model-View-Controll (MVS) architecture**:

- **Model**: Handles database-related operations and represents core data logic.
- **View**: Manages what the user sees; includes HTML templates and user interfaces.
- **Service (Controller-like)**: Acts as the middle layer connecting models and views, handling business logic and application flow.

This separation of concerns improves code organization, scalability, and maintainability.
